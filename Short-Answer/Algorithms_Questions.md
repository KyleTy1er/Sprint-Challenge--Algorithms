# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I

Give an analysis of the running time of each snippet of
pseudocode with respect to the input size n of each of the following:

```python


```


```

```

```



## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken 
if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. 
Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.
